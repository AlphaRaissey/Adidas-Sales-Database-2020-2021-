# Adidas Sales Database-(2020-2021)

This project is part of a 4-week Data Analysis Bootcamp with Nexo Girls. The goal was to go beyond charts and build a dashboard that tells a story with data. Using Excel alone, I analyzed two years' worth of Adidas sales data to understand the key drivers of revenue, profit, and performance across products, regions, and time.
## Introduction

I built an interactive Excel dashboard to break down Adidas sales data from 2020 to 2021 and uncover what’s truly driving revenue, profit, and overall performance. The dashboard visualizes key insights across product categories, regions, store types, and time periods. With built-in slicers for States, Months, and Retailers, stakeholders can instantly filter the data and drill into specific segments — without ever touching the raw spreadsheet. It’s designed for clarity, speed, and smarter decision-making.
## Dataset Overview

The dataset captures detailed transactional records from Adidas sales, spanning thousands of entries across various regions, retailers, and product categories.It includes key variables such as:
- Retailer  
- Region  
- State and City  
- Sales Method  
- Product Category  
- Units Sold  
- Revenue  
- Cost  
- Profit  
- Date
## Dataset Source

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, a well-known platform for real-world datasets and data science projects. It provided a solid foundation for analyzing Adidas’ sales performance in a structured and reliable format.
## Objective

To make sense of Adidas’ sales performance, I set out with the following objectives
- Analyze trends in sales and profitability
- Identify top-performing regions and product categories
- Spot inefficiencies in product performance
- Build an interactive, user-friendly Excel dashboard
## Data Cleaning

Before diving into analysis, I cleaned the raw dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Key steps included:
- Removal of duplicates  
- Handling of missing values  
- Formatting of data types (e.g., dates, numbers)  
- Creating of two new columns: Month and Day of the Week (extracted from the Invoice Date)  
These steps were crucial to prepare the dataset for smooth pivoting, accurate filtering, and clean visuals.
## Charts and Visualizations
The dashboard uses a consistent design theme with clean layouts and shades of gray to align with Adidas' brand aesthetic. Visuals were chosen to make insights immediately clear and easy to explore.
Key visualizations include: 
 1. **Total Sales by Product Category**  
 2. **Monthly Sales Trend**  
 3. **Sales Breakdown by Sales Method**  
 4. **Sales by Region**  
 5. **Sales by Retailer**  
 6. **Average Operating Margin by Product**  
 7. **Top Cities by Total Sales**  

## Dashboard Overview

The Adidas Sales Dashboard (2020–2021) provides a comprehensive view of the company’s sales performance across multiple dimensions including products, regions, retailers, and time periods. I added interactive Slicers for Product Category, Store Type, Region, and Month. This allows stakeholders to instantly filter the data and focus on specific areas of interest without interacting directly with the raw dataset. The result is a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard built entirely in Excel — designed for clarity, speed, and business decision-making.
## Tools Used

 Microsoft Excel ( Data cleaning, data summarization, analysis dynamic visualizations)  
## Files Included


## Key Insights

- Certain segments significantly outperformed others in both revenue and profit margin, indicating strong consumer demand and effective pricing in those areas.  
- One sales channel continues to outperform others, but all channels contribute meaningfully to total revenue. There's potential to optimize underutilized channels further.  
- A few distribution partners are responsible for a major share of performance, while others aren’t meeting expectations. This could point to gaps in availability, visibility, or partner alignment.  
- Sales trends show clear cyclical behavior, with distinct high and low points during the year. This seasonal pattern can guide future inventory planning, promotional timing, and forecasting.

## What I Learned

- How to turn a raw dataset into a clear, actionable dashboard using only Excel  
- The importance of clean data for accurate analysis and smooth dashboard performance  
- How to use Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers together to create an interactive user experience  
- How design choices (color schemes, layout, filters) impact the clarity and usability of a dashboard  
- How to analyze business performance across multiple dimensions: time, product, region, and channel  
- Most importantly, how to extract insights that drive smarter decisions — not just pretty visuals
