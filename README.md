# Adidas-Sales-Database-2020-2021-
This project is part of a 4-week Data Analysis Bootcamp with Nexo Girls. The goal was to go beyond charts and build a dashboard that tells a story with data. Using Excel alone, I analyzed two years' worth of Adidas sales data to understand the key drivers of revenue, profit, and performance across products, regions, and time.
